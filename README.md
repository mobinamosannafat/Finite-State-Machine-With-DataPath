# Finite State Machine With DataPath

In this repo yo can see implimentaion of the largest GCD algorithm with the ability to use any combination of 11-bit numbers (Considering the sign bit). The 2's complement format is used to display negative numbers. The circuit have an interface for repetitive input data (e.g. using buttons and switches) as well as output results (e.g. using LEDs).

You can find the source codes in the [codes directory](./codes) and test cases in the [test-cases directory](./test-cases).


# Modules

Program includes five modules:
- Adder
- Complement
- GCD
- PkgFile
- StateAssign


# More details

You can find the FSM diagrams and datapath diagram in the [diagrams directory](./diagrams). Those will help you better understand the issue.
